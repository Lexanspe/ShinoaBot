# ShinoaBot
Making a discord bot using discord.js 

I managed to organize the commands. As you can see there is a commands folder inside src folder. That folder contains all the slash commands you can use via ShinoaBot. It's the first beta version because now there is no issue with the commands. If you have any questions or find a bug, you can contact me on discord: @lexanspe
